## Bitwise Operations

The goal of these exercises is to foster a basic understanding of bitwise operators and how they work.  Using these operators, we learn how to manipulate numbers at a bit level.

|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0-binary_to_uint.c | - Converts a binary number to an unsigned int     |
| 1-print_binary.c   | - Prints binary representation of a number        |
| 2-get_bit.c        | - Get the nth bit of an integer argument          |
| 3-set_bit.c        | - Sets the bit value of number at index to 1      |
| 4-clear_bit.c      | - Sets the bit value of number at index to 0      |
| 5-flip_bits.c      | - Count bits needed to turn 1st argument into 2nd |
|100-get_endianness.c| - Return the endian status of the environment     |
