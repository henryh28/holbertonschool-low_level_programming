## More Singly Linked Lists

The following exercises are further works dealing implementing linked lists.

These exercises build upon the skills established in the previous ones by having us learn how to pop nodes off a list, how to iterate and manipulate the datas in the nodes of the list, and how to delete specific nodes and reverse the linked list.

|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-print_listint.c        | - Return the number of nodes in a linked list                           |
| 1-listint_len.c          | - Return the number of nodes in linked list argument                    |
| 2-add_nodeint.c          | - Add a node to the beginning of a linked list                          |
| 3-add_nodeint_end.c      | - Add a node to the end of a linked list                                |
| 4-free_listint.c         | - Frees memory in use by linked list argument                           |
| 5-free_listint2.c        | - Frees memory in use by linked list argument and sets its head to NULL |
